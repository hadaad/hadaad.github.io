We have to get a move-on!&quot;</p> <p>Levon chuckled, hearing his dwarf friend grumbling, but Dolby knew Levon wouldn't give him an order like that if it hadn't come from Rook or Marnie, and so he was pleased to hear what he'd expected in the tent, accompanying the grumbling -- the hurried packing of the dwarfs pack.</p> <p>Like the rest of the group, but unlike Levon himself, Dolby was happy to carry a small tent on his back in return for protection from the elements. Levon preferred to sleep under the stars, and had a waxed tarp for a lean-to in the rain.</p> <p>As Levon was consistently the first one packed, he usually fetched water, got the fire going, and had a hearty porrridge boiling while the others were still trying to strap their tents under their packs.</p> <p>Dolby wasn't lazy, he was happy to tell anyone, he just understood the benefits of enough sleep.</p> <p>Levon couldn't complain about Dolby. In fact, it was usually the opposite, andDolby was more than willing -- and able -- to carry his own weight, once the second moon had vanished from the sky.</p> <p>Levon certainly was happy to get his work out of the way early. It gave him lunch time and dinner time free to pursue his favourite pastime: looking around.</p> <p>It wasn't like there was anything different about this stretch of wilderness than any other. Rocks were rocks and streams were streams. But if you knew how to listen, to read the tale of the forest -- and what woodland elf of greater Sharland could not -- even the same copse could tell a different story each day.</p> <p>&quot;What do you see, Levon?&quot; Levon had heard Rook's approach. The man would never equal one of the owold elves, but he could slink quietly when it suited him.</p> <p>The tale of this glen is of many men moving in unison.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Soldiers?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I leave interpretation to you, boss. Many men, many horses. You can see here,&quot; he pointed to a slight depression in the ground, &quot;and here.A&quot; Some bushes where the berries of a bush had gotten squashed.</p> <p>&quot;I see nothing, Levon. Which direction?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;They head northeast -- or at least they did when they passed through here.&quot; Levon looked at Rook. This was the first time the human hadn't protested that he wasn't in charge. Rook looked distracted. He took off his pack and withdrew a notepad and pencil. Levon left him to his note-taking and returned to camp.</p> <hr> <p>Everyone was ready to go when Rook got back to camp. even Dolby had his gear stowed. Rook wondered if Marnie or Onyx had helped teh dwarf, but then decided it didn't matter. He wasn't a sergeant, training raw recruits and making sure everything was done properly. In their line of work, as long as the job got done, it didn't much matter how it was accomplished. He pushed aside the lingering insistence that doing things the right way -- the <strong>army</strong> way -- made everything easier in the long run, and entered camp.</p> <p>Once everyone was ahorse, Rook opened his map.</p> <p>&quot;Villagers say the pool is fiteen leagues north of Edgerton. Got some of their villagers injured, trying to pull fish out of there. They say it's a giant serpent, maybe even a naga, come to curse their waters for their sins.&quot;</p> <p>Dolby made the sign of The Few on his chest and murmured under his breath. Levon looked at Dolby and a huge grin spread on the efl's face. Crap.</p> <p>&quot;Anyway, they've offered us silver to dispose of whatever it ends up being. Marnie?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Edgerton is on the crossroads that feed into the south, west into the mountains, and east on into Castor. They've made their business hospitality and provisioning. One or more food sources drying up could be disastrous for the town. I've negotiated a very good sum for this job.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;How much?&quot; Levon asked. But of course he did. He always did.</p> <p>&quot;We're looking at three-fifty apiece. Plus.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Plus?&quot; Levon asked.</p> <p>&quot;They've fed our horses, and us, and they've given us maps of the area.&quot; She waited for more questions, but there was nothing but silence.</p> <p>&quot;So if we're good,&quot; Marnie turned and looked at Onyx, who nodded. They all breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Excellent. We kill the dbeastie, throw the head in a sack, bring it back to town, and we're flush once more.&quot;</p> <p>Dobly snorted and Levn had the good grace to blush. Nobody really wanted to get into the reason they were desperate for coin -- why they were seemingly always desperate for coin - but Marnie had done what she could to mitigate the financial risk that came with running with Dolby and Levon.</p> <p>Without any more to say, they set out.</p> <p>&quot;So... the spriit of the water, come to judge the living, eh?&quot; Levon asked in too-loud tones.</p> <p>&quot;Levon,&quot; Rook said, almost pleading.</p> <p>They'd been riding some hours, with no stopping, and it was obvious that Levon was getting bored.</p> <p>&quot;What, Rook? I'm just repeating what the townsfolk said to Marnie. that does represent quite the pickle. If this is a naga, set to judge Edgerton, it's going to be quite tricky to kill. And if we do kill it, does that mean we've thwarted the will of the Few? And all for a measly few coins?</p> <p>&quot;Need I remind you,&quot; Marnie cut in, &quot;that we wouldn't have to be scrounging for measly coins if you hadn't fallen head-first into a dice game and bet more than you had?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Well... technically, I <em>did</em> have the coin,&quot; Levon said, then realized that was the wrong thing to say. Rook stifled a chuckle. Levon did get the point eventually, even if it was usually too late.</p> <p>Marnie, however, didn't take the bait. She gave Levon a glare that left no uncertainty that they would revisit the issue of how the elf had come into possession of the group's communal coin at another time.</p> <p>&quot;At any rate,&quot; she continued, &quot;this is good work. This is teh kind of thing we signed up for, and your nonsense doesn't change that.&quot;</p> <p>Judging by Dolby's pained expression, though, some things had changed.</p> <p>&quot;Listen, Cap,&quot; Dolby said when they'd stopped for lunch. It was a good three quarters of teh way to the pol, if the map had any claim to accuracy, and they were well-fed on the provisions they'd gotten from Edgerton. The dwarf had pulled Rook away from the group, and now spoke in hushed tones.</p> <p>&quot;I think I might need to bow this one oet.&quot; Dolby looked miserable. He always looked miserable when he was delivering bad news to Rook or Marnie, like they were going to drag him back to the north and dump him back into a fighting pit.</p> <p>&quot;Listen, Dolby. I'm not in charge. We agree to things. I'm not- ugh. Listen. Why can't you fight a giant serpent?&quot; The answer was obvious, but Rook felt it would be best to confront this right now.</p> <p>&quot;I just... a naga, Cap, sent by the Few? I can't be party to that. I'm as partial to coin as any... well, any save Levon. But this is our immortal souls we're talking about and I'd rather not put that in jeopardy.&quot;</p> <p>Not that this was the first time Dolby had let Levon get into his head, but it was best if he nip this in the bud now.</p> <p>&quot;You'll do your share,&quot; Rook told Dolby.</p> <p>&quot;I just don't know if I can, Cap.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You'll do your part. You agreed to be a part of this group, this merry band of sellswords - (&quot;Well, I do use an axe&quot;) - and you know that there's only two reasons we back out of a job: money and Onyx. marnie says the money's god, and we've gotten nothing from Onyx.</p> <p>&quot;You think she'd risk your immortal soul? You see anything amiss in Edgerton to make you think they were especially sinful? Like the Few don't have enough on their plates, they gotta involve themselves in the lives of those who provide food.</p> <p>&quot;I'm cutting to the chase now. You'd see it in time, and I'm not going to order you around, but you'll see it right, and you'll do your duty when the time comes.&quot;</p> <p>Dolby didn't say anything, and he didn't react. He just stood there with his head cocked to the side. The dwarf was usually pretty sensible, if you showed him the angles. Rook patted Dolby on the shoulders and went back to pack up.</p> <hr> <p>Rook leapt to the side as a giant appendage crashed down where he'd stood. Tail? Tentacle? He didn't know and he wasn't sure how much difference it would make if it connected. He could see why the villagers would call it a serpent, though. Only one of teh appendages ever surfaced and the creature's head never surfaced. But that didn't seem to hamper the thing's aim.</p> <p>An arrow lodged into the creature, penetrating the thick hide, though not deeply. Rook jabbed at the appendage with his sword, having had a previously hacking attack bounce off, harmlessly.</p> <p>This attack did penetrate the monster's skin, and the appendage jerked and retreated to the water, taking Rook's sword with it. Rook grunted with frestration and pulled out a dagger -- one of four. That was the only sword he'd brought with him.</p> <p>Mere seconds brought another attack, one that saw Rook lose his footing and hit the ground inches from where the attack fell. Mud shot inte Rook's face, and he sputtered, spitting grit and slime. He looked up hopefully, but there was no sword. No arrow. No broken flesh.</p> <p>&quot;Dolby!&quot; he cried, rolling to his feet as this new appendage returned to the water, just ahead of another arrow from levon. &quot;Dolby! Your soul is fine! Get the Hells over here and fight!&quot;</p> <p>Wiping off his face, he turned and saw that Dolby had not moved. He stood with Onyx and Marnie. Rook turned back, but the water was still.</p> <p>&quot;Dolby! This isn't a naga. It cannot be. That is no serpent's tail. My sword wasn't there! Come earn your pay!&quot;</p> <p>The next few moments were hectic for Rook, and he forgot about the dwarf as one of the thing's appendages flailed about in the air as the thing realized Rook was quick enough to dodge the slam-into-the-shore attack from before.</p> <p>Rook gave off any pretense at attacking and put all his efforts into dodgeing -- lurching to the side, rolling, even one successful jump over the half-foot-wide tentacle. When the second appendage emerged from teh water, Rook squinted, seeing the gleam of his sword protruding from teh creature.</p> <p>An arrow thunked into the undamaged appendage as it swung close to Rook, and it jerked. The change of direction took Rook y surprise and the tentacle took his feet out from under him. He hit the ground hard and rolled to the side immediately as she saw the second tentacle above him.</p> <p>Another close call and the missed attack seemed to stun the damaged tentacle. It sat there long enough for rook to regain his feet and clutch at his sword. He pulled, but the thing would not move, like it had been cemented in place.</p> <p>The second tentacle loomed overhead and Rook used the damaged one to shield him from its twin. He kept at his sword, pulling it from side to side, succeeding only in dragging the damaged tentacle across the ground. Finally, after one swiping attack from the active tentacle, a close call that had Rook diving over the damaged tentacle and rolling, he gave up on his sword and plunged his dagger into the tentacle beside his sword.</p> <p>Again, something inside the east seized and held the knife fast. Rook threw his hands up and looked back at the rest of the group, only to see Dolby charging, axe drawn.</p> <p>The dwarf vaulted a fallen tree and launched himself through the air, his axe raised overhead. Dolby landed, bringing the axe down in a mighty chop, severing the tentacle above the sword and dagger.</p> <p>&quot;Grab your sword now, Cap!&quot; he said, raising his axe defensively.</p> <p>The counter-attack was not slow in coming, and it focused completely on Dolby as Rook retrieved his now loosened sword and dagger. He watched as Dolby dodged the attacks of the enraged monster.</p> <p>But it wasn't a desperate defense that saw Dolby working to avoid being hit. Rook could tell it was strategic, methodical. Dolby was waiting for an opening - an opening he was confident would present itslef. Dolby had faced one of these monsters before.</p> <p>Dolby stood on the shore of the lake, his arms outstretched, axe gripped halfway down the shaft in one hand.</p> <p>&quot;Come on!&quot; he roared at the monster. As if in response, the tentacle stood straight up from the water and slammed down towards Dolby. The dwarf calmly stepped to the side and, shifting his groip on the axe, brought it down a mere second after the appendage struck the shore. His aim was true and the tentacle fell from its body.</p> <p>&quot;Quick now, Cap,&quot; Dolby said, jumping on the severed stump. It writhed in his grasp, even lifted the dwarf off the ground, but Dolby helf firm. &quot;Grab the other one and let's bring 'er in!&quot;</p> <p>Rook sheathed his sword and reached out for the stump of the tentacle that had been severed first, but not without some trepidation. Ichor oozed from the creature, like blood, but black and putrid-smelling. He grabbed the thing gingerly and it wriggled weakly in his grasp.</p> <p>&quot;Don't be shy, Rook!&quot; Levon called from behind him. &quot;Really dig in and grab it!&quot;</p> <p>Rook groaned, but did as the elf suggested. He hauled on the remains of the tentacle, which gained a frantic sort of vigour as he hauled it away from the water. Dolby, ho'd mastered the other tentacle and regained his feet, did the same.</p> <p>They dragged the creature from the water. It resisted at first, making each inch a small victory, but eventually, they hauled it, making progress a foot at a time.</p> <p>A near-spherical head lay at the root of the tentacles, which were still twenty or more feet long, though Rook imagined that if his fingers had had their tips cut off, he wouldn't be looking to get into any slap-fights. Whether that was the reason or loss of bodily fluids, the fight seemed to have gone out of the creature.</p> <p>&quot;We could probably just leave it to bleed out on the shore,&quot; suggested Marnie. &quot;Seems likely we'd just get something stuck if we stabbed it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We can't&quot; Dolby said. &quot;These bastards regenerate, and they don't need the water to survive; they just prefer it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I won't ask how you know that, Dolby,&quot; Marnie said. &quot;So how do we kill it?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Dolby said. &quot;We were never allowed to get that far. Once we incapacitated it, we'd won and were returned to our cells.&quot;</p> <p>Marnie looked at Rook then, and the sadness in her eyes was unmistakeable. There was nothing they could do now though. They'd done what they could to secure his freedom. Memories were another thing entirely.</p> <p>&quot;I would have to guess that thing has a brain somewhere,&quot; said Levon. &quot;You'd have to imagine a hard enough blow would put it out of its misery.&quot;</p> <p>In the end, it came down to marnie and Rook. Nobody disputed that Dolby could hit harder than Rook -- harder than anyone Rook had ever met, truth be told, but Marnie's spells worked on affinity, and she and Rook had been friends forever. They had a mallet from the camping gear - a sword was no good for driving net stakes into rocky ground -- and Marnie cast a Concussive Force enchantment on it right when Rook struck. If there had been any doubt about whether they'd finished the job, it was alleviated when Dolby stabbed adagger into the monster's tentacle and was able to extract it again.</p> <p>&quot;It's the muscles, you see?&quot; he said. &quot;At least that's what me and the boys figured. Musles seize around the weapon stealing it from the attacker and preventing blood loss.&quot;</p> <hr> <p>All the way back to Edgerton, Rook was plagued with nightmare-like thoughts of Dolby fighting one of these beasts on repeat, a day's victory meaning only that he lived to face another horror the next day, or the day after that.</p> <hr> <p>The townsfolk were all proper appreciaion at the grisly procession that made its way through the centre of town. Grisly less because of their appearance -- they had taken opportunity at the lake before leaving - than for the dismembered corpse of what Dolby simply called the Water Bastard. Even with the agreement to provide proof, they'd been divided on whethere to return with the head. Surprisingly, Marnie had convinced the rest of the group to return with the trophy.</p> <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; she'd said at the time, &quot;it makes for a disgusting traveling companion, but it's only a day or two, and I think the council at Edgerton will require proof. For a group of people desperate to be rid of danger, they were a very transactional lot. I'd rather sleep with that thing nearby than have to turn around and get it again.&quot;</p> <p>now the thing stared out at nothing with golden eyes, only now starting to film over. At least it had stopped leaking.</p> <p>&quot;Excellent,&quot; the town selectman said, keeping his distance from the water bastard's corpse. &quot;Deal made, deal kept. Have a nice day.&quot;</p> <p>Nobody moved. Marnie cleared her throat, then, when the selectman turned to go, she spoke up.</p> <p>&quot;Um, our pay,&quot; she said. She was uncomfortable talking about money, about handling money, but she couldn't very well leave it up to the kids, and Rook wanted nothing to do with anything that suggested he might be in charge.</p> <p>&quot;Pay?&quot; The selectman was incredulous. &quot;That was all arranged before you left.&quot;</p> <p>Marnie panicked a little, thinking taht maybe Levon had managed to be the recipient, but then she remembered that Levon hadn't entered town. None of them had, save her and Onyx.</p> <p>&quot;Arranged, how?&quot; she asked.</p> <p>&quot;You don't remember? Interesting.&quot; Rook stiffened at the obvious condescension in the man's tone, but no more than that.</p> <p>&quot;We agreed to three-fifty apiece.&quot; She was getting frustrated, but tried to keep it professional.</p> <p>&quot;Then you proceeded to raid our larders. You took food in lieu of coin. Food that the town was already lacking, given the problem that you so graciously solved for us.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You said-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I said that I agreed to pay the amount, then I said we could see to your provisions. If you assumed we were gifting you with the fod, that was your assumption, and not my -- or the town's -- responsibility.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;There's no way our food cost three-fifty apiece! The price-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;The price was set by the council prior to your arrival. Emergency rationing leads to higher prices.&quot;</p> <p>Marnie had had enough of this man cutting her off, making it sound like she'd agreed to something she had not.</p> <p>Rook had, apparently, had enough too.</p> <p>&quot;Listen here,&quot; her partner said, stepping forward.</p> <p>&quot;Wait, Rook,&quot; she said, barring his way forward with an out-stretched arm. &quot;You deal with the beasts out of town. This one is mine.&quot; She hoped the selectman was left with no doubt what she thought of him. She adopted a breezy tone.</p> <p>&quot;You know, we don't actually know the proper name of this beast.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don't-&quot; the selectman said, but Marnie cut him off, ignoring the thrill that gave her.</p> <p>&quot;No, but our dwarf over there,&quot; she gestured; Dolby waved. &quot;He's fought one of these before. Called it a Water Bastard. Funny thing about this guy -- he regenerates. Leave him for dead, come back next week, his... things,&quot; she wiggled her fingers and pulled a sour face, &quot;they just grow right back.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Now, listen,&quot; the selectman said, his voice a little shaken. Marnie, however, continued.</p> <p>&quot;They can be dazed pretty easy, but my friend over there, he fought these things over and over, and never properly was able to kill one.&quot; She paused, but the selectman had nothing more to say. Good. She had his attention.</p> <p>&quot;Funny thing about our contract, too,&quot; she said. &quot;It didn't say anything about killing the water bastard, just getting it out of the lake. Well, it's out.&quot; She looked around and brightened.</p> <p>&quot;Ah. the well. That will do nicely.&quot;</p> <hr> <p>Rook sat at his desk. He wondered at Marnie. He had known they brought different skills to their partnership when they'd agreed to work together - when <em>she'd</em> proposed they work together, but he had to admit that if it came down to it, she'd shown that she was the harder one by far. He also knew that, if it had been up to him, he would have just taken the situation as a lesson and moved on.</p> <p>They had taken the water bastard, which he now knew was called a Giant Bifurcated Moray, away from the area. Marnie knew of a druid who wasnt too far out of the way who might pay for a chance to study the corpse. They'd dropped it there, earned a pittance, and learned a little about their opponent.</p> <p>The moray, it turned out, had been thought to be cleared out of the kingdom some decades ago. They traveled deceptively quickly, though, and whith the new king's less stringent border policies, it was possible that giant bifurcated morays would be appearing with more regularity in the kingdom's waterways.</p> <p>Another brief piece of news that Roald, their druid friend, casually dropped, and that left a stunned look on Marnie's face until they were back on the road, was that it was possible the moray was still alive.</p> <p>&quot;Those muscle seizures that hold your weapon in an unbreakable grip, they go slack when the moray enters a healing coma, which is very much like what you described to me. I'll know within a week if this particular specimen is still alive.&quot;</p> <p>He set aside thoughts of sea serpents at a knock to his door. When he opened it, he was not surprised to see Dolby, his hat in his hands.</p> <p>&quot;Come in, Holby.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Thanks, Cap. I won't stay long. I just wanted to say I was sorry.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Yeah. I'm sorry. Sorry I couldn't follow orders, sorry I sat out until I knew what it was we were fighting. I was scared and I let that fear hold me instead of trusting what you said.&quot;</p> <p>Rook sighed.</p> <p>&quot;First, I'm not in charge. Yes, there are times when I have a plan and you need to follow along so we don't get killed. But just as often, you have a plan and I need to follow your lead. Like with the water bastard.&quot;</p> <p>They both smiled.</p> <p>&quot;You're your own person, Dolby. Yo get to decide what you engage with. When I said I knew you'd do your job, it wasn't because it was an order, but because I knew you would come to understand how silly a premis it was that the Few would send a naga to menace the lakes of a middling trade town.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;When you and the lady bought me-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Dolby.&quot; Rook cut the dwarf off. &quot;We didn't buy you. We don't own you. We bought your freedom. Yes, w like having you in the group, and yes, it was Levon's recommendation after having seen your fighting skill, but you don't belong to us. If you decided to leave and go back home - no, wait.&quot; Dolby had started to protest.</p> <p>&quot;If you did decide to do that, even after we tried to convince you to stay, you could go, because we do not own you.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I'd never leave on my own, Cap. I hope you know that. Me and Levon like it here with you and the lady.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I know, Dolby. And I hope you always feel the same way.&quot;</p> <hr> <p>&quot;So the numbers we were talking about in that glen,&quot; Rook said, going over his notes.</p> <p>&quot;No fewer than five hundred, maybe as many as a thousand.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Right.&quot; Rook made another notation in his book. &quot;And the timeframe?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Based on the damage to the flora, and the amount of regrowth,&quot; Levon looked up and to the left, &quot;maybe a week before we crossed the path.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;That path in a more-or-less straight line would have come from the Grelland border at Ashar Keep. Even in the old king's day, we didn't have that many men there. With the purge, there's no way the kingdom had that many people stationed there.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Boss?&quot; Levon said, but Rook wasn't paying attention.</p> <p>&quot;So either the Keep was overrun or...&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Boss!&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What?! And don't ...&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Marnie is coming.&quot;</p> <p>Rook rolled up his map, folded his notebook, and tucked them on a shelf, seconds before there was a knock at the door. Rook cleared his throat and let Marnie in.</p> <p>&quot;I've paid the others,&quot; she said. &quot;I've come to give you yours. Oh, hello, Levon,&quot; she saidnoticing the elf.</p> <p>&quot;Ah. Thanks,&quot; Rook said, trying to project innocence.</p> <p>Marnie looked at Rook, then back over at Levon, back to Rook, and rolled her eyes.</p> <p>&quot;I'msure I don't even want to know,&quot; she tossed a bag of coins to Rook, who caught it, and turned to go.</p> <p>&quot;Goodnight, gentlemen.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Ah, Marnie?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Levon?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;My pay?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Went out already. Two weeks early. Remember?&quot;</p> <p>Rook remembered, and more importantly, he remembered Marnie threatening to leave the Water Bastard in the well at Edgerton. He hoped, for Levon's sake, that the elf had the sense to drop it.</p> <p>Showing uncharacteristic good sense, Levon demurred.</p> <p>&quot;Fair enough.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Good night,&quot; Marie said, and left.</p> <p>&quot;What reason would the king have for letting Grelland soldiers cross through the kingdom? Or are they doing it covertly?&quot; Rook stared at the desk as though the map were still there, as though he could squeeze the secrets from the wood. Finally, he gave up. He crossed to the shelf where he'd stowed map and notebook and put them where they belonged. Marnie would, no doubt, have another job for them soon, and it didn't make sense to waste his off-hours trying to put together a puzzle when he was missing so many pieces.</p></div></div> <!----> <div class="tag-cloud--container" data-v-7b2be707>
