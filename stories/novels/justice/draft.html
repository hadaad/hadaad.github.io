The Narwhal, as it was known to its regulars, was home to degenerates of all stripes. Longshoremen with a thirst for drink, sailors looking to spend their pay on the Smoke, even heroes, either washed up or never-was, looking for a game of chance or company for the night. Any vice, any customer, as long as the price was paid.</p> <p>On the main, the laughter on any given night could be primarily attributed to Old Bran, a giant of a man, made even larger by soft living and excess. Many would, and had, sat with Bran and, for the price of a drink or two, listened to the obviously-embellished, but nevertheless entertaining, stories of Bran's youth, when he strode the land making his living with a broadsword as the hero, Branaghan the Bold.</p> <p>As a hero, Bran had been affable, approachable, ever one to take a youngster on to help them prove themselves capable before they moved on to their own groups. As a retired former hero, Bran was still affable, still open to receiving anyone; welcoming with a slap on the back or a knowing look.</p> <p>Bran held court near-nightly, holding forth on the lay of the land and how things were &quot;in the good old days.&quot; He would lament, with comically tragic features, the introduction of the crossbow and recent improvements in armour. He would go on for days about the berserkers he worked with, who would stride into battle with, &quot;a club and a loincloth,&quot; lamenting the loss of the old ways.</p> <p>Most nights, he was entertaining, and while he was entertaining, he was drinking. Other nights, he would, with his affable nature, and his good name, beg drink for future promises, and drink himself into a stupour. It was on these nights that his daughter, Caoimhe, would come looking, and drag him home. It was the rarest of nights when Caoimhe could not come to get her father, and on a night when entertaining was slow, and Bran found himself beyond the ability to stir himself enough to go home, he begged a spot on the floor from Rina, the night manager of The Narwhal. Of course, even when so besotted he could not find his way to the exit, he still exuded that charisma that had won him the hearts of common people when he was a hero, clearing the land around the city, and had won him countless cups of oblivion since, and Rina could not find it in herself to evict her biggest customer on a night when the city was preparing for the onset of winter. It would not kill him to spend a night out-of-doors, but, hell, he was harmless, and damn near immobile. It would be more effort than it was worth at this hour to move him out the door, even if he was willing to go.</p> <p>Still, if she'd known what the day manager would see when he came in to open up, she would have expended the effort. Instead, she left him on the floor, where he seemed content to lie, and locked him in.</p> <p>When the doors opened in the morning, just before lunch, the light streamed through the door and Denard was five minutes in opening before he noticed Bran on the floor. He had his rituals, and didn't make his way out to the bar proper right away. To Denard's credit, though, it didn't take him any time at all from seeing Bran on the floor to noticing the twin daggers sticking from the old hero's chest.</p> <p>The Thirsty Narwhal didn't open that night, and was closed the following day as well, but once the body was gone, things were cleaned up, and there didn't seem to be any trouble coming for the bar, it went back to business as usual. People, after all, needed their release.</p> <h2 id="chapter-1"><a href="#chapter-1" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chapter 1</h2> <p>On the hard days, even getting out of bed seemed to be an unclimbable mountain.</p> <p>It wasn't the physical act of rising from her bed, though moving easily and smoothly was definitely something in her past. Instead, it was the sheer act of deciding to get out of bed.</p> <p>Usually, in those days, it was the job that got her out of bed -- some thought or another that unlocked a question or, rarely, answered one. Most often, the hard part of the job was figuring out what the right questions were to ask, and coming to that overnight was definitely something that lent the rare spring to her step.</p> <p>The problem was, as often as not, there wasn't any work. No work, no real reason to get out of bed.</p> <p>Friends would tell her that was an unhealthy way to look at life, living for the job. They would if they existed, but she started flying solo more seriously as the scars from Rin and Harlow's deaths faded. She leaned on friends pretty hard for awhile, but soon, pride overwhelmed grief and Fleta was left embarrassed. Used to being the tough one in the relationship, in the family, it was an embarrassing concession, just how much she put on her friends. They were happy to give me support, give me time, but it didn't do for a hero to blubber into her dinner companions' blouses.</p> <p>'Not that I'm a hero anymore,' she forced herself to remember. She solved problems in the poor quarter of Turbald's Landing. She found things for people, found people for people, and found the secrets that people held that had the power to destroy families. Though she tried not to put too much of an emphasis on it, she knew she sometimes carried the fates of the vulnerable and their predators in her hands. Where once she defended Turbald's Landing from threats from without, now she guarded its most vulnerable citizens from attacks from within the city.</p> <hr> <p>She should really be happy. She didn't want to think of it as a dry spell. If she framed it better, it could be that she'd been so good resolving problems within the poor quarter that nobody really had anything to complain about anymore. But it really did leave her with very little to do. The thrill was in the seeking, in the finding, in the problem solving. Catching up on her invoices did have the benefit of getting her paid, but it did very little to occupy her mind.</p> <p>Not for the first time, she gave thought to going back to being a hero. There was always work in the countryside for a hero with as much experience as she had. She refused to think of it as &quot;for a hero as old as she was.&quot; But there was very little risk for her outside of the usual mortal peril. That had never been her concern, though. She and Rin had laughed over the worst-case scenario, knowing it was the longest of long shots that some work that she did out-of-town would come pay her back in the city, especially when the entire guild of heroes was built to prevent that exact thing.</p> <p>How they had laughed.</p> <p>And she thought about a return to the Heroing world. There was certainly enough work around for Fleta Whisper, and she could do good work. But then she thought about the work she did within Turbald's Landing -- going through the invoices helped with that as well, serving as almost a diary of her good works.</p> <p>There wasn't much glory in solving the problems of the insolvent. Nearly as much notoriety as pay when you dealt with the lowest of the low, but she knew the impact she'd had on the community, and even when the people she helped didn't see fit to recognize her efforts, she knew she made a difference. So maybe slow-day invoice processing was good for occupying her after all.</p> <p>In the end, it was all in the way that you framed it. Everyone had a story to tell themselves, and the way you told it had as much to do with your outlook as the contents of the story.</p> <p>Rin had been a good storyteller. He was always patient and framed things in a way that made the outlook less bleak. In fact, he'd made his living telling the stories of heroes, villains, and monsters, of pacts dark and secret, and the people who brought them to light, to justice.</p> <p>Not for the first time -- not for the first time today -- she wondered what story he'd told himself and Harlow when the High Wizard's conjured golem had torn them apart.</p> <p>'No more of that,' she scolded herself. She couldn't frame that in a positive way, but she didn't have to dwell on it, either. She opened the drawer on the desk that she'd bought with the earnings from her first case and swept the invoices in. Clean desk, clean start. She could go after delinquent clients later.</p> <p>Fleta was climbing out of her own head when the front-door chime sounded. It was a good bit of extravagance she'd splurged for. She didn't employ anyone to work at a desk out front, and she did all her office work in the back office. Better to keep things separate. Meeting clients in the front room, pondering and filing in the office, sleeping in the bedroom, cooking and eating in the kitchen. All that filled the one-floor building.</p> <p>Fleta emerged from the office to see her next potential client and was struck by the twin feelings that the young lady evoked in her.</p> <p>First, the neat clothes, definitely clean, yes, pressed as well, possibly tailored to fit. Clean skin, clean hair, well put-together. This was not an example of someone who generally had cause to engage Fleta's services. That she came from money, or at least from a family that had been consistently employed through the ups and downs of the rocky fortunes of Turbald's Landing was clear. Taking this picture and nothing more from the young lady would leave Fleta infuriated. This was not the client who would walk through those doors. Where the girl came from had Fleta imagining her tip-toeing through the neighbourhood, trying to to get any grime on her. It might have been unfair, but some of that scorn stuck to her even as she moved past the obvious wealth to the girl herself.</p> <p>A sympathetic pang caught Fleta when she examined the girl's face. Loss. Tragedy. It was all laid bare for Fleta to see.</p> <p>Fleta was no fool. She had navigated investigations through the dankest bits of the poor quarter and she liked to think that she had what it took to penetrate the best of cons. What she saw here was no play for sympathy, no wheedling for a better price with a few tears. This was raw loss and it hit Fleta like a slap to the face. She knew what it was as soon as she saw it because she had lived with it for the past two years.</p> <p>Despite the fact that neither she nor this girl was overly interested in starting a conversation -- the image of cats leering at one another, sizing each other up, occurred to Fleta and then was gone -- something had to give. In this case, it was the young woman.</p> <p>&quot;Are you Fleta? Fleta Whisper?&quot; she asked with no false bravado, but no awe either. Just a question.</p> <p>&quot;I was. I haven't gone by Whisper in a long time. But I am Fleta.&quot; Fleta remembered her courtesies and gestured to one of the client chairs.</p> <p>&quot;How may I be of service?&quot;</p> <p>They moved to the desk and Fleta took her seat. She'd heard that some businesses offered prospective clients water, but she didn't suppose that she would be doing that any time soon. That was for fancy places, and she would never be that.</p> <p>This prospective client didn't look around for refreshment. Her mind was very clearly on exactly what she had come for and nothing more, so Fleta did her the courtesy of getting to the point.</p> <p>&quot;People come here for a very small list of reasons. I don't host friends -- I don't have friends -- and you wouldn't be here if you didn't want my services. So what is it I can do?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;My father was murdered.&quot; Speaking of getting to the point.</p> <p>&quot;My condolences. The police-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;The police are not interested in a non-entity like my father.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;That is a very harsh-&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It is exactly what they said to me before sending me your way. Trust me, I would rather not be here. I would rather not have any reason to be here. But my father died, the police rejected my claim, and so here I am. I would like you to find whoever it was that murdered my father, and I would like to be able to bring them to justice.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Justice is a tall order, um...&quot; Fleta faltered, realizing that in all the getting to the point, she'd forgotten introductions.</p> <p>&quot;Caoimhe,&quot; her prospective client said. Fleta tested it in her head a few times befor she got the jist.</p> <p>&quot;And your father...? I'm going to need all sorts of details about him. Name, age, potential enemies... You know, details about the case that make you believe he was murdered. All that good stuff.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;My father was Bran. They called him Branaghan the Bold when he was a hero, but he's been Bran as long as I've been alive. He was-&quot;</p> <p>Fleta cut her off. Branaghan the Bold was murdered? Holy shit.</p> <p>&quot;Hang on. Branaghan the Bold? I almost worked with that guy once.&quot; What Fleta didn't say was that she'd been warned away from Branaghan by a number of her colleagues. You kept one eye on your money pouch when you worked with Branaghan, it was said, and the other on your back, lest you find a knife protruding from it.</p> <p>Something must have changed in Fleta's face, though she tried to hide it. Caoimhe's face fell.</p> <p>&quot;I know the rumours, I know what they said about him in his heroing days. But that was all in the past.&quot;</p> <p>'Yeah, one full-grown, if young, woman in the ago,' Fleta thought.</p> <p>&quot;I don't deal in rumours, Caoimhe. I work the case as it presents itself. Your father's colourful past means that the potential list of suspects is long. That doesn't make the job impossible, it just makes it harder. I'm not here to judge your father; that lies on the other side of The Gates. I will follow the case as far as I can, and if I can find out who killed your father, I will give you the name of the killer. If this is agreeable to you, and,&quot; here, Fleta flipped through her ledger until she found the page she needed, then turned the book towards Caoimhe, &quot;if this fee schedule is reasonable, then I will start right away.&quot;</p> <p>Caoimhe's eyes popped when she saw the total on the ledger page, but she quickly composed herself and nodded.</p> <p>&quot;The financial terms and the work you will provide are agreeable,&quot; Caoimhe said, trying to sound professional. But Fleta had seen the girl's face when she'd seen the total at the bottom of the ledger. Fleta would have to work with a different fee schedule. She'd assumed that since Branaghan had been a hero, there would be more money to work with, but that very much did not seem to be the case.</p> <p>She realized that she had been projecting her own life onto the life of a different hero. Just because she was fiscally frugal didn't mean that others had the same view. She sighed over her misstep, shook her head, and wrote up a contract with the revised fee schedule. Caoimhe signed and they stood there, looking at each other awkwardly again. Fleta cleared her throat.</p> <p>&quot;Well. I will need to know where they found your father, any details about his body when they found it, and more.&quot; It was time to get to work. She could dwell on the past later.</p></div></div> <!----> <!----> <!----></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
