I thought about a vacation with no limits -- anything I wanted.</p> <p>What I would want is a vacation through time, and I think that if a job could provide a week of vacation per decade of my life, TO each decade of my life, that is probably a job I would stay at until I retired.</p> <h2 id="the-ground-rules"><a href="#the-ground-rules" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Ground Rules</h2> <p>You don't get to change anything in your life. You go back, and you can make different decisions based on how you would want the world to react, but it doesn't change its own future. This is an experiential sandbox.</p> <h3 id="_0-9-years"><a href="#_0-9-years" class="header-anchor">#</a> 0 - 9 Years</h3> <p>I would probably cling to my mom's side, get to really know, with my grown-up mind, my mother as a mother, the woman who smoked, who sang, who played piano so beautifully. If I had to pare it down to a day, I would spend at least three hours of that day listening to her play that song on the piano that she spent so long trying to master. I'd definitely spend more time with my brother and sister, just to remember what we were all like back then.</p> <h3 id="_10-19-years"><a href="#_10-19-years" class="header-anchor">#</a> 10 - 19 Years</h3> <p>I think I would probably spend an inordinate amount of time playing sports, glorying in the vitality of my young body. I spent countless hours playing street hockey, baseball, football... anything that I could find enough people to play. I would definitely fight my coaches for the ability to play running back or quarterback in some capacity. That would be awesome.</p> <h3 id="_20-29-years"><a href="#_20-29-years" class="header-anchor">#</a> 20 - 29 Years</h3> <p><strong>So many things</strong> happened in this decade. Honestly, I have no idea which things I would do. Definitely go on some dates with my wife. Probably kick around university a little bit, try to soak up some more knowledge than I let permeate me the first go-round. Definitely hang out at the birth of my oldest daughter. One hell of a vacation, that's for sure.</p> <h3 id="_30-39-years"><a href="#_30-39-years" class="header-anchor">#</a> 30 - 39 Years</h3> <p>I would spend more time with my mom as she descended into her illness. That would be hard, especially since I couldn't change anything. But I think that <em>not</em> doing it would be something that I would regret for a long time. I would spend time in each of the three houses we owned, just soaking up the atmosphere. I would go back to the birth of my youngest daughter.</p> <h3 id="_40-present"><a href="#_40-present" class="header-anchor">#</a> 40 - Present</h3> <p>I don't have much nostalgia for the past four years yet. I'd probably go back to some jobs and say things that I couldn't at the time, because I was worried about the repercussions. Nothing bridge-burning, but words that would make things better for both the companies I worked at and the people who worked there.</p> <p>Go ahead, technology. Catch up to my dreams. I dare you.</p></div></div> <div class="date-section" data-v-7b2be707><p data-v-7b2be707>Posted on Friday, October 11, 2019</p></div> <div class="tag-cloud--container" data-v-7b2be707>
