Feels like years since I used a blog to update on the various goings-on in Liam-land. Mostly because it <em>has</em> been years. I can't pretend I can guarantee anything like consistency on the updates front, but there's this post, at least, so there you go.</p> <h2 id="what-s-liam-up-to"><a href="#what-s-liam-up-to" class="header-anchor">#</a> What's Liam Up To?</h2> <p>There are a few things I've been up to since COVID hit and things like Roller Derby and leaving the house stopped happening.</p> <h3 id="new-keyboard"><a href="#new-keyboard" class="header-anchor">#</a> New Keyboard</h3> <p>'Oh boy, Liam bought a new keyboard! Stop the presses!'</p> <p>Normally this wouldn't be a big deal - hardly worth mentioning, but I'm buliding this keyboard from scratch. Maybe, once I've got it working, I'll actually write a post with more detail, but I got to the end and found it doesn't work, so I really don't want to get into it just now.</p> <h3 id="cross-stitch"><a href="#cross-stitch" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cross Stitch</h3> <p>Early on in the social distancing, I started work on the third of four dragons in a pattern. I made terrific and quick progress. Then I stopped. No idea why. It just didn't feel important or urgent anymore.</p> <p>I also started a programming project for designing cross stitch patterns. It's something I could publish on this site, but it's currently an ugly mess and I haven't paid attention to it in more than a month. Again, it just stopped feeling important.</p> <h3 id="writing"><a href="#writing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Writing</h3> <p>My latest project (that doesn't involve a soldering iron) has been organizing my writing into a single bitbucket repository. That probably means something to a lot fewer of you than not. Suffice it to say, I have cast my writing far and wide over the years, between dropbox, two google drives, various computers, notebooks, and even a floppy disk here and there. I'm spelunking through places I haven't been in years and recovering writing that... well, let's just say there's a lot. And a lot more beginnings than endings.</p> <p>I know Cliff used to give me a hard time about not ending anything, but this is straight-up ridiculous. 22 novels I've started, and only managed to finish four and fully abandon one.</p> <p>My track record with short stories is a lot better. I have more than 60 completed, with only <span title="or probably, once I've finished archiving, I'll find it's 10 or 12">two or three</span> that I haven't finished.</p> <p>I've been working without a portable laptop since Lily started schooling from home. I'd bought a used 2012 Macbook Pro (I've blogged about it on here) but with her needing a reliable computer for her daily online classes, I essentially gave her that <span title="Technology flowing through me to other members of the family is nothing new, and could probably be the subject of a completely different post.">computer</span>.</p> <p>In order to keep writing, take advantage of the new writing repository, and to mitigate the lack of a <span title="apart from my work laptop, which I don't care to use for personal work">laptop</span>, I've bought some things to make my iPad more usable:</p> <ul><li>Dongle - this lets me connect an external USB keyboard to my iPad, which is better than either the on-screen keyboard or the Apple Magic Keyboard.</li> <li>Working Copy - this software lets you edit files from a git repository on an iPad. I had to pay 28 bucks for a license that lets me push changes to the server, but it's worth it. The software is beyond solid, and meets a need.</li></ul> <h3 id="fighting-father-time"><a href="#fighting-father-time" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fighting Father Time</h3> <p>In order to push off the need to buy another <span title="that will probably be given away to yet another family member">laptop</span>, I've put SSDs into my Mac Mini from 2010 and my Dell Inspiron from 2008. Neither of them is exactly what I want in a computer, but both of them have elements that I want in a computer. After all, writing isn't the only thing I do at the computer.</p> <p>One thing I haven't worked on is getting a comment system on this site. So I'll have to hope you're keeping busy instead of asking what you've been up to.</p> <p>Stay safe,</p> <p>Liam</p></div></div> <div class="date-section" data-v-7b2be707><p data-v-7b2be707>Posted on Monday, June 29, 2020</p></div> <div class="tag-cloud--container" data-v-7b2be707>
