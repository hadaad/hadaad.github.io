What?</p> <h3 id="q-seriously-though-what"><a href="#q-seriously-though-what" class="header-anchor">#</a> Q Seriously, though. What?</h3> <p>TL;DR: Roller derby is a sport where one player on each team -- The Jammer -- scores points by lapping the blockers on the other team. The first trip through the pack does not count for points, with one exception.</p> <p>The first jammer to legally pass all of the blockers on the other team and escape the pack on their iniial pass earns lead jammer status, which gives them the right to call off the jam at any point, with some exceptions.</p> <p>After the initial pass, for every blocker the jammer passes, they earn a point for their team. Jams last two minutes or until the lead jammer calls off the jam.</p> <p>This continues for two 30-minute halves and whichever team has scored the most points by the end of the game wins.</p> <h3 id="q-what-s-with-the-jammers-going-out-of-bounds-then-going-back-to-the-back-of-the-pack-sometimes-they-don-t-are-those-jammers-cheating"><a href="#q-what-s-with-the-jammers-going-out-of-bounds-then-going-back-to-the-back-of-the-pack-sometimes-they-don-t-are-those-jammers-cheating" class="header-anchor">#</a> Q What's with the jammers going out of bounds then going back to the back of the pack? Sometimes they don't. Are those jammers cheating?</h3> <p>When a player is hit out-of-bounds, they aren't allowed to come back in bounds in a superior position. What that means is that anyone who was in front of them when they went out has to be in front of them when they come back in. They also can't come back in in front of the person who knocked them out of bounds. This doesn't just apply to jammers, but to all players. There are some exceptions to the rule, but when you see someone skating to the back out of bounds, that's why.</p> <h3 id="q-the-ref-yelled-something-and-threw-their-hands-in-the-air-then-the-blockers-stopped-blocking-what-gives"><a href="#q-the-ref-yelled-something-and-threw-their-hands-in-the-air-then-the-blockers-stopped-blocking-what-gives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Q The ref yelled something and threw their hands in the air, then the blockers stopped blocking. What gives?</h3> <p>In order for derby to be played, there has to be a pack, which means some combination of blockers from both teams within ten feet of each other. If the two teams are too far par, or if two groups with similar numbers of blockers for each team (think two groups of 2 red, and 2 blue, or a group with 3 red : 1 blue and one with 3 blue : 1 red) and those two groups are more than ten feet apart, the ref will call &quot;No Pack!&quot; and the blockers' only job is to re-form the pack, or there will be penalties.</p> <h3 id="q-why-does-one-blocker-have-a-stripe-on-their-head"><a href="#q-why-does-one-blocker-have-a-stripe-on-their-head" class="header-anchor">#</a> Q Why does one blocker have a stripe on their head?</h3> <p>The pivot has a couple of powers that a regular blocker doesn't. The most important of these is that a jammer can remove their helmet cover and hand it to their pivot, making the pivot the jammer and transforming the jammer into a blocker.</p> <h3 id="q-what-s-with-all-the-whistles"><a href="#q-what-s-with-all-the-whistles" class="header-anchor">#</a> Q What's with all the whistles?</h3> <p>At the beginning of the game and the second half, at the end of the half and the game, and at the end of timeouts, there's a long whistle. It either signals the end of play or that there are 30 seconds until the next jam starts.</p> <p>After five seconds is called, a single whistle signals the start of the jam.</p> <p>A single whistle during the jam means that a penalty is being called.</p> <p>Two quick whistles during a jam means that a jammer has been awarded lead jammer status.</p> <p>Three sets of four whistles signals the end of a jam.
One set of four whistles means that a timeout has been called.</p> <h3 id="q-and-the-hitting"><a href="#q-and-the-hitting" class="header-anchor">#</a> Q And the hitting?</h3> <p>You can hit other players with any part of your body from mid-thigh up to your neck, and your upper arms down to, but not including, your elbows. You can hit the other player in all those parts except in the back. And you have to be moving in derby direction (counter-clockwise)while initiating the hit.</p> <h3 id="q-why-didn-t-that-player-get-a-penalty-they-clearly-broke-the-rules"><a href="#q-why-didn-t-that-player-get-a-penalty-they-clearly-broke-the-rules" class="header-anchor">#</a> Q Why didn't that player get a penalty? They clearly broke the rules!</h3> <p>The referees have to determine if a rule was broken, and also if advantage was gained from the illegal activity. If someone breaks the rules but there is no impact to the game, there won't be a penalty unless there is a safety concern. There are a couple exceptions to this.</p></div></div> <!----> <div class="tag-cloud--container" data-v-7b2be707>
