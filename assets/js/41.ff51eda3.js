A year it's been, or close enough, since I stopped altering my body and started down a different track to prevent the war.

Yet I cannot bring myself to commit suicide.\nThis would be a problem if I didn't have a younger self who would do everything I conmmanded.\nThree weeks I pondered the situation. THree weeks in which I contemplated the repercussions of what I planned.\nI had lived lives great and small - lives I could be proud of, and lives that would make a normal man blanch at the body count. Nothing I ever did changed a single thing that mattered, so there would be no \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" style regrets for me.\nEventually, I reached the conclusion that this was the only solution.

I would not be hurting anyone else - it would be me I was killing off.

I did as you asked, and eventually understood your strategy. Borrowing from your strategy, I figured out, at the same time, how to prevent the explosion. But I also saw that, once the war was prevented, you would not come back.\n\"You see, for some reason, as each iteration happened, just as you were able to remember past lives, so was I. I knew your purpose in coming back as well as you did. I, however, had another purpose. Immortality.\n\"As long as you kept returning, I could continue my research, furthering the cause of humanity. I needed a solution. You may find it implausible that I invented a machine to alter memories, to erase existing thoughts and replace them iwth new ones. But, considering you managed to create a time machine - a feat that I haven't been able to reproduce this side of the thought divide - I firmly believe that you will come to accept it.\"\nI stared at this part of the letter, amazed. Thought-erasure. What a concept. And yet... thought divide? I had to read on.\n\"How many years of life I've taken from you I can't give back. And for that, I feel a little guilt. But look back - really focus - on the years we've gained; all the knowledge. I believe, and I think you will come to agree.\n\"I implore you not to close your eyes to the possibilities that your wonderful invention opens up. I have already learned so much, done such good.\n\"I know that you did not come up with whatever the missing piece was for the time machine. That must have been provided to you by another. I know this, because of the first few iterations. I did not erase our memories on those passes, and so everything that you knew, I also knew. I also know that you would not have been able to live with that lack of knowledge. I know that you would have come to understand the technology with it sitting right in front of you.\n\"I have not had that same luxury, so I am stymied on this side of the thought divide. If you were to share it with me - with your youth - think of all the good that might be done all throughout history!\"\nThe letter was similarly unsigned.\nI thought about all I'd learned - about memories, both false and real, about the arrogance of youth. I thought about how used I'd been, and how blind I'd let myself become to the world outside this room. The food replicator created my meals. The toilet took them away. It had never occurred to me, over the years, to run diagnostics on the outside world, to see if my memories could be trusted. It had been a toxic wasteland before, and I'd grown accustomed to the idea of a life in isolation. It is likely that my seclusion for the last half a dozen yeras had all been to further my past self's ambitions.\nI won't say I was untempted by the offer. But even as the false memories faded - explosion after explosion, extinction after extinction, I realized that handing time travel to a person who could torture another over and over, convince them of the futility of their own existence, and lead that person to suicide would be a mistake.\nI made my decision, even as I quieted my inner voice. It said that my experiences would be a moderating factor in the younger version of me. That there was no thought divide, and that young me would have to resolve the same cognitive dissonance that I had. In the end, whether it was because I could not trust myself or because the younger version was truly that different, I could not go back.\nThe letter was correct. I had figured out, with study, how the contributions of Dr. Lehrer worked. She had been a genius, but it didn't take that level of thought to reconstruct another's work, and if pressed to it, I could reproduce the time machine from the bolts out. I could not pass that knowledge on to a younger, more impetuous version of myself, who had not lived with lifetime after lifetime of the consequences of man's inhumanity to man. Not when any danger to him, anything that threatened his - our - life also threatened nuclear annihilation, again. I destroyed the time machine. I left my room and navigated to where I knew the memory machine to be. Sitting in the seat (I had become an expert in the use of this machine thanks to this most recent pass through life), I targeted my knowledge of the making of the time machine. Then I ended my exile and re-entered a world in bloom, full of life and possibility.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
